#ReadyReader

ReadyReader is a mobile reading platform intended for on-the-go readers who utilize their modile devices as their primary means of reading.

Primary contributors are as follows:

- [Ben Brostoff](https://github.com/BenBrostoff)
- [Greg Knudsen](https://github.com/greg99799)
- [Brendan Susens-Jackson](https://github.com/bsusensjackson/)

This project was built using the Ruby on the Rails and additionally followed a JavaScript MVC pattern on the client side. We prioritized responsive design in building ReadyReader, as the impetus for the project in part was using mobile devices for long commutes. We attempted to use a Test Driven Development oriented approach throughout this project, and made use of [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) and [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) to achieve this purpose.

We owe a great debt to our Dev Bootcamp instructor [Matt Bunday](http://zencephalon.com), without whom this project would not have been possible. Matt came up with the original idea for ReadyReader and trusted us to execute on his vision.

We are further in debt to our Phase 3 lead Dev Bootcamp instructor, [Rebecca Miller-Webster](http://www.rebeccamiller-webster.com/). Rebecca provided frequent consulting on this project and devoted significant time to guiding us through the issues we encountered on the road to deployment.

Rebecca and Matt - thank you.

We welcome pull requests, questions and comments.
